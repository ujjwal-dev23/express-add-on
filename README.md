## The Workflow (PLEASE READ)
1.  **Never push to `main` directly.**
2.  **Create a Branch:** Before starting a task, create a new branch: `git branch -b feature/your-task-name` (or use the "New Branch" button in GitHub Desktop).
3.  **Commit Often:** Small, frequent commits are better than one massive one at the end.
4.  **Pull Request (PR):** When your feature is ready, push your branch and open a PR. **Ujjwal** will review and merge it.

## Troubleshooting
* If you get a merge conflict: Ask in the WhatsApp group.
* If you're using an LLM: Copy-paste our folder structure into the prompt first.
